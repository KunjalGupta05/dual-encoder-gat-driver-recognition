# dual-encoder-gat-driver-recognition

## üß† Overview

Distracted driving is a major cause of road accidents. This project introduces a dual-encoder architecture combining convolutional and graph-based representations to classify different types of driver behavior. Graph Attention Networks are used to model spatial and contextual relationships between image regions.

## üìÅ Datasets Used

### 1. [Kaggle: State Farm Distracted Driver Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection)
- A benchmark dataset containing images of drivers performing actions like texting, talking, adjusting the radio, etc.
- 10 classes of driver behavior.
- Collected in controlled environments.

### 2.[Multi-Class Driver Behavior Image Dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/mzb4b6dff3/1)
- Collected in Ashulia, Dhaka inside public buses and private cars using mobile phones.
- Captures real-world driving conditions with varied lighting and environments.
- Includes 5 behavior classes: Safe Driving, Turning, Texting, Talking, and Others.
